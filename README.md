SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction using Python
Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify whether a given sonar signal is reflected from a rock or a mine (metal cylinder).
It’s a binary classification problem based on the SONAR dataset, which contains 208 samples and 60 features representing sonar signal returns.
 Objective
To build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an object detected by sonar is a mine (metal) or a rock (non-metal).
Dataset
Name: SONAR Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Sonar Data Set
Description: Each record contains 60 sonar readings (numerical values) and a label (R for Rock, M for Mine).
Technologies Used
•	Python 3
•	NumPy
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn
Model Building Steps
•	Data Loading and Exploration
•	Load dataset using pandas
•	Understand data distribution and label balance
•	Data Preprocessing
•	Convert categorical labels to numeric
•	Split dataset into training and test sets
Model Training
•	Use Logistic Regression (or any chosen ML model)
•	Train on the training data
Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate accuracy on both training and test data
•	Analyze performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
Results
•	The model achieves good accuracy in classifying sonar signals.
•	Demonstrates effective use of supervised learning and binary classification concepts.
